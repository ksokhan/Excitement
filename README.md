What is it?
===========
Excitement is a simple [arduino](http://arduino.cc/) and [processing](http://processing.org/) application that displays the world's excitement by polling twitter, and displaying the results as an interactive visualization.

Rationale
=========

I wanted to explore the possibilities of joining a very immediate, tactile interaction with one more abstract to create a piece that is organic, yet meaningful. The immediate interaction&mdash;that of the button being pressed&mdash;is reflected on the computer screen through the movements of a series of moving dots, which seem to get 'excited' and start swirling around in a big 'cloud'. An led lights up, confirming your interaction, and brightens as you press the button down longer, provoking you to watch and see what happens. The abstract aspect, is a constant polling of twitter for tweets with the word 'exciting'. Each time a tweet is posted, the second led blinks, and a new dot enters the screen.

Installation
============

To get things working, take a look at the diagrams under the 'wiring' folder to hook up your Arduino. Then upload your code to it, and finally, open the processing.pde and click run!
